If you are having any problems, draw a diagram for the TA and show him
or her what you are trying to do.  You need to figure out as much for
yourself as possible.

0. Create package prog04 and install DLLEntry.java, DLLBasedPD.java,
   and Main.java.

1. Read DLLBasedPD.java up to save().  In save(), put in the missing loop.

2. In add(), add the new entry to the end of the list.  Test your
   program by running Main.  Add a new entry, save, and make sure it
   appears in csc220.txt.

3. Finish find().  Test.

4. Finish removeEntry().  Test.

Your tests should include adding, finding, and removing elements from
the beginning, middle, and end.  It should not crash when you remove
all the elements, nor when you add to an empty directory.


HOMEWORK

5. Change Main to use SortedDLLPD.  Copy your current find code into
   SortedDLLPD find.

6. In SortedDLLPD add, call find and then insert the new entry where
   find tells it to.

7. Modify find so it stops when it gets to the entry after the name it
   is looking for and returns it instead.

   Again, thoroughly test your program.
