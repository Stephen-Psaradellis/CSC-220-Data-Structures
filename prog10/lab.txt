-1. When doing this assignment, don't delete my comments.  Please try
    to put your code where the comments indicate.

0. Create package prog10.  Go get BTree.java.

1. Read over the definition of the Entry that I went over in class.
   Make sure you understand it.

2. Implement findInList using the comments provided.

3. Implement findInListOfLists using the comments provided.  When you
   are sure you have got all the cases right, have the TA check you.

4. In find, do the two cases.

5. Run.  containsKey should work correctly.  (But get won't work, and
   put will cause an exception.)

6. Implement get.  Does it work now?

7. Look over split and put carefully.

TRY TO GET 8 DONE DURING LAB.  ASK QUESTIONS.

8. Do the missing parts of the recursive insert method.
   **ADD EACH LINE AFTER MY COMMENT** so you can check yourself later.
