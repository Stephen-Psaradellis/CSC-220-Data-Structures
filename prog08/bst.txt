A binary search tree is ordered so that everything in the left subtree
of each node has lesser key that that node and everything in the right
subtree has greater key.  This enables to find the node with a given
key quickly.

find(key, root):  find the node with key in the tree rooted at root
	tree is empty?  return null
	key is at root?  return root
	key < root key?  recursively find in left subtree
	key > root key?  recursively find in right subtree

Node find (K key, Node root) {
	if (root == null)
		return null;
        if (key.compareTo(root.key) == 0)
		return root;
        if (key.compareTo(root.key) < 0)
		return find(key, root.left);
	else
		return find(key, root.right);


	               3
	       1               5
	           2       4       9

Let's say you are looking for key==4.  Root has key==3.
Root is not null.
key is not less than root key.
So recursively look in right tree, rooted at key==5.

If you believe in recursion, we are done.  But maybe you are not sure, so...

	Root has key==5.
	Root is not null.
	key is less than root key.
	So recursively look in left tree, rooted at key==4.

		Root has key==4.
		Root is not null.
		key equals root key.
		Return node with key==4.

	Return node with key==4.

Return node with key==4.


add(K key, V value, Node root)
	tree is empty?  return new Node with key and value
	key < root key?  recursively add to left subtree
			 and replace current left subtree with result
			 and return root
	key > root key?  recursively add to right subtree
			 and replace current right subtree with result
			 and return root

Why return root?  Well suppose the input key==6 and root is the node
with key==3.  (Let's not worry about values.)

	               3
	       1               5
	           2       4       9

This is the result.  Well, what is the root of this tree?  The node
with key==3, right?  So that is what you should return.

	               3
	       1               5
	           2       4       9
	                         6

Node add (K key, V value, Node root) {
	if (root == null)
		return new Node(key, value);
	if (key.compareTo(root.key) < 0) {
		root.left = add(key, value, root.left);
		return root;
	}
        else {
		root.right = add(key, value, root.right);
		return root;
	}

Removing a node is the trickiest.  Suppose we wanted to remove the 3.
That would split the tree into two.

	                
	       1               5
	           2       4       9
	                         6


The fix is to replace it by the rightmost node in the left subtree or
the leftmost node in the right subtree:

	               2
	       1               5
	                   4       9
	                         6

OR

	               4 
	       1               5
	           2               9
	                         6

Node remove(key, root)
	key == root.key? return removeRoot(root)
	key < root.key? recursive call on left tree
	key > root.key? recursive call on right tree

Node removeRoot(root)
	left subtree is empty?  return right subtree
	right subtree is empty?  return left subtree
	newRoot is rightmost in left subtree
	remove rightmost from left subtree
	replace root with newRoot
	return root

Node getRightmost(root)
	right subtree is empty? return root
	recursive call on right subtree

Node removeRightmost(root)
	right subtree is empty? return right subtree
	recursively remove rightmost from right subtree
