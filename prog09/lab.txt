0. Create package prog09.

1. Finish implementing InsertionSort and test.

2. Ditto HeapSort.  (Uncomment line in main.)

3. Ditto QuickSort.

4. Ditto MergeSort.

5. For homework, measure the running time of each sorting algorithm on
   larger arrays of Integer.  If the user provides a size on the
   command line, then make the array that size and initialize it with
   random integers.  (random.nextInt() gives a random integer).

   Don't print out the array if it is bigger than a 100 in size.

   Print out the running time of each method for different sizes.  Use
   System.nanoTime() but print out the time in milliseconds.

6. Write the merge method in ExternalSort.  Test on number.txt and
   then make your own file with different lengths to make sure you have
   it right.
